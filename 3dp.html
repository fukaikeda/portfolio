      <h1>üß© Evaluating the 3DP User Experience</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">Understanding how makers of all levels interact with 3D printers in a student-run space</p>
  
      <h2>üß© Context</h2>
      <p>The Brown Design Workshop (BDW) is a student makerspace used by over 1,000 members. While it fosters creativity 
        and experimentation, the sheer volume and diversity of users often lead to usability challenges. As a monitor, I 
        observed friction in how users interacted with our 3D printers and decided to investigate.</p>

      <h2>üë§ Audience</h2>
      <p>The BDW community includes students from diverse disciplines. Some are highly technical, while others 
        have limited experience in fabrication. Monitors (like myself) are trained users who help facilitate safe 
        and effective use of the space. Understanding both perspectives is key to designing inclusive workflows.
      </p>
  
      <h2>üéØ Design Goal</h2>
      <p>Improve the 3D printing experience across different user skill levels by identifying pain points in the 
        interface and environment, and proposing actionable improvements that support learning and reduce frustration .</p>
  
      <h2>üß† Research & User Feedback</h2>
      <p>I started by studying the physical and software interface of the Prusa 3D printers‚Äîthe default machines at BDW. 
        While simple in appearance, their interface hides complexity that can confuse new users.</p>
      
      <figure class="case-image">
        <img src="images/prusa.png" alt="A diagram of interactive components on the Prusa">
        <figcaption>A diagram of interactive components on the Prusa.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>One concern I had after interaction with the interface itself is how many of the settings are 'bundled' together,
         and the difficult callibration settings are often mixed up with the print settings, which may provide a 'black hole'
          experience for the beginning users.</p>

      <p>Based on this, I conducted observational research on three users‚Äîa beginner, an intermediate user, and an expert‚Äîto understand how 
        interactions differ by experience:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Beginner:</strong> Confused by printer setup and unsure of protocol; asked others for help.</li>
        <li><strong>Intermediate:</strong> Comfortable slicing and uploading prints, but struggled to find available machines.</li>
        <li><strong>Expert:</strong> Actively troubleshot machines and maintained them, frustrated by others' misuse.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <p>I also interviewed them. Their top challenges included:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Beginners:</strong> Understanding settings and basic operation</li>
        <li><strong>Intermediates:</strong> Managing failures and printer availability</li>
        <li><strong>Experts:</strong> Dealing with systemic misuse and printer upkeep</li>
      </ul>
  
      <p>Top joys included:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Creativity and freedom to make anything</li>
        <li>Quick prototyping</li>
        <li>Access to free, high-quality tools</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h2>üîÅ Personas & Storyboarding</h2>
      
      <p>As mentioned in the last section, these users have such different experiences. Therefore, I begin to focus on a more
        niche user. I do this by creating two personas based on the observations I conducted. They are both beginners,
        but have different struggles.</p>

        <figure class="case-image">
            <img src="images/p1.png" alt="User that finds difficulty in asking for help">
            <figcaption>Persona of Stephen, a tech savvy user.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          
          <p class="paragraph">Stephen is tech-savvy, but he has trouble with asking for help. His biggest interface
                issue is troubleshooting. Users like him are common, as many people traditionally have it down
                but struggle in uncommon situations. 
        </p>

        <figure class="case-image">
                <img src="images/p2.png" alt="User that finds difficulty in software">
                <figcaption>Persona of Tiffany, a beginner.</figcaption>
              </figure>
            <p class="paragraph">Tiffany has no trouble asking for help, but the software is difficult for her to use. Her
                biggest challenge is the software interface and settings. Users like her are common too, as many people do not
                use the 3dp software often.
        </p>

        <h2>‚úèÔ∏è Storyboarding</h2>

         <p>Then, I focus even more on a specific user by taking their journey and storyboarding it. This 
            process allows us to understand the specific points in a user's journey and their emotions in each,
            highlighting key points of improvement. </p>

            <figure class="case-image">
                <img src='images/story2.png' 
                alt="User uses software to upload 3d print onto SD card">
            </figure>
            <figure class="case-image">
                <img src='images/story3.png' 
                alt="User runs into a callibration error and cannot fix it">
            </figure>
            <figure class="case-image">
                <img src='images/story4.png' 
                alt="User tries to find help, but feels shy and walks out">
            </figure>
 
            <p>From this activity, we can understand that the lack of support and confusion is a key point in 
                a negative experience of a beginning user, and that it can scare away users from using the devices. This is both
                something that the software can improve on (beginner-friendly debugging) but also the environment itself (support system).
            </p>
   
      <h2>‚úÖ Key Insights</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The software is learnable but not intuitive for infrequent users.</li>
        <li>Advanced users struggle with system-level usability, not just interface design.</li>
        <li>Peer support and environmental design (e.g., signage, queue systems) are as important as software tweaks.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h2>üìö Takeaways</h2>
      <p>While I can't redesign Prusa's firmware, I can make an immediate impact by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Creating better signage for troubleshooting</li>
        <li>Training monitors to support diverse users</li>
        <li>Urging more peer support and communication within the space</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This project deepened my appreciation for inclusive design in shared, physical-digital environments.</p>
