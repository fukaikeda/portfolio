        <h1>üè∫ Pottery at Brown : A Storage System Redesign</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Designing a low-tech, high-trust workflow for handmade object storage</p>
    
        <h2>üß© Context</h2>
        <p>At Pottery @ Brown, glazed ceramics were frequently lost or mixed up. Sticky notes fell off 
            shelves, and members didn't know where to store items. This caused stress and inefficiency 
            in a tight space with rotating users.</p>


        <figure class="case-image">
            <img src="images/initial.png" alt="Style guide">
            <figcaption>Initial state of studio</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h2>üë• Audience</h2>
        <p>The storage system serves a diverse group of users at Pottery @ Brown. This include first-time 
            ceramicists to experienced studio aides.</p>
            
        <h2>üéØ Design Goal</h2>
        <p>Create a clear, easy-to-follow system that lets users store, label, and find their pieces
            without complex software or overburdening staff.</p>
    
        <h2>üß† Research & Feedback</h2>
        <p>Through interviews and observations, I found:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Members often had trouble finding work</li>
          <li>There was limited storage space</li>
          <li>Studio would get messy quite fast</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>üîÅ Iterations</h2>

        <p>Based on these initial interviews and observations, I tried several ideas.</p>

        <figure class="case-image">
            <img src="images/sticky.png" alt="Pottery with sticky note labels">
          <figcaption>Adding sticky notes to pieces</figcaption>
        </figure>


        <figure class="case-image">
            <img src="images/box.png" alt="Pottery in a box">
          <figcaption>Making a box with unlabel pieces</figcaption>
        </figure>


        <ul>
          <li><strong>Sticky Notes:</strong> Failed due to reliability, would fly off </li>
          <li><strong>Etching Initials:</strong> Difficult to do on wet work, sometimes unidentifiable.</li>
          <li><strong>'To Claim' Box:</strong>Difficult to organize </li>
        </ul>

        <p>While these solutions did not completely work, they gave me valuable insights to form my final
            system.
        </p>

        
    
        <h2>‚úÖ Final System</h2>
        <p>Using what I realized from these solutions, I came to my final system.</p>

        <figure class="case-image">
            <img src="images/finalpottery.png" alt="Pottery in a taped off area with QR codes">
          <figcaption>Final solution of taped off area and QR code form</figcaption>
        </figure>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Labeled zones by stage (e.g. ‚Äúready to fire‚Äù)</li>
            <li>QR code linked to a shared form for name, photo, and date</li>
          </ul>

        <p>The new system improved clarity and reduced misplaced pieces. Monitors could cross-check submitted forms, 
            and members appreciated having a reliable place to leave their work.</p>
    
        <h2>üìö Takeaways</h2>
        <p>This case taught me the importance of ideations. A combination of low-tech and physical design can
            be just as impactful as a high-tech solution.
