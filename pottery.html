        <h1>🏺 Pottery at Brown – A Storage System Redesign</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Designing a low-tech, high-trust workflow for handmade object storage</p>
    
        <h2>🧩 Context</h2>
        <p>At Pottery @ Brown, glazed ceramics were frequently lost or mixed up. Sticky notes fell off shelves, and members didn’t know where to store items. This caused stress and inefficiency in a tight space with rotating users.</p>
    
        <h2>🎯 Design Goal</h2>
        <p>Create a clear, easy-to-follow system that lets users store, label, and find their pieces—without complex software or overburdening staff.</p>
    
        <h2>🧠 Research & Feedback</h2>
        <p>Through interviews and observations, I found:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Sticky notes fell off due to airflow and dust</li>
          <li>Written names were unclear or inconsistent</li>
          <li>Members were frustrated by lost or mislabeled work</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>🔁 Iterations</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Sticky Notes:</strong> Failed due to reliability</li>
          <li><strong>Marker Labels:</strong> Visually messy, not universally legible</li>
          <li><strong>Taped Zones + WR Code:</strong> Best solution</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>Labeled zones by stage (e.g. “ready to fire”)</li>
          <li>WR code linked to a shared form for name, description, and date</li>
          <li>Printed instructions posted above shelves</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>✅ Final System</h2>
        <p>The new system improved clarity and reduced misplaced pieces. Monitors could cross-check submitted forms, and members appreciated having a reliable place to leave their work.</p>
    
        <h2>📚 Takeaways</h2>
        <p>This case taught me that UX design doesn’t have to be digital to be impactful. Clarity, affordances, and trust matter just as much in physical systems. Prototyping in context revealed what would and wouldn’t work.</p>
