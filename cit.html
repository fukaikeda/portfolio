    <h1>🎨 Repainting the CIT</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Using color and student input to reimagine a well-used academic space</p>
  
    <h2>🧩 Context</h2>
    <p>The Center for Information Technology (CIT) is one of the most frequented academic buildings at Brown, 
        especially for CS majors. Despite its importance, the building's interior is very dreary, 
        and often the source of student complaints.</p>

        atmosphere.</figcaption>

    <h2>👤 Audience</h2>
    <p>My primary audience was the students who use the CIT regularly. These students often spend 
        long hours in the space, and their comfort and focus are directly influenced by its atmosphere. 
        Secondary audiences included teaching staff and building administrators, who care about 
        promoting a functional and welcoming environment.</p>

    <h2>🎯 Design Goal</h2>
    <p>To evaluate how the CIT's color palette influences student mood, focus, and comfort—and 
        propose a student-informed, cohesive redesign.</p>
  
    <h2>🧠 Research & Feedback</h2>
    <p>I conducted observational walkthroughs and informal interviews. My findings included:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Liked:</strong> Lots of sunlights in fifth floor</li>
      <li><strong>Disliked:</strong> Dreary tones and uncoordinated furniture</li>
      <li><strong>Functional insight:</strong> Colors affect mood and movement through space</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h2>🔁 Iteration</h2>
    <p>I created multiple palettes and layout tests. The strongest concepts emphasized calming 
        blues balanced with warm tones.</p>

    <h2>✅ Final Proposal</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Unified wall colors per floor (cool tones for study spaces)</li>
      <li>Coordinated trim and accent color scheme</li>
      <li>Upgraded seating to match the palette</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>📚 Reflections</h2>
    <p>This project reminded me how much space affects experience. Small interventions,
        especially when co-designed, can create a better environment.</p>
